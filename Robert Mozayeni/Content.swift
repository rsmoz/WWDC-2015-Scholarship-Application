It then removes the caption bar and text, compensating for the lost image data using the Open Computer Vision library.\n\nMy code for Snappp is almost entirely Swift, but there's also some Objective-C, Objective-C++, and C++.\n\nSnappp has been downloaded over 63,000 times and has more than 25,300 monthly active users. Every day, users collectively spend nearly 2 days' worth of time using Snappp. At the time of writing, 23 people currently have the app open.", Action.AppStorePage("896890211")),

It uses the Multipeer Connectivity framework in iOS, and then uses it to build a mesh architecture. This mesh network is then used to extend one device's internet connection to other devices, even those that are not immediately connected. If device A is connected to device B, and B to C, and C to D, then if D wants to make a web request, it can relay the request to A, which will execute it and send the data back to D. If cellular networks are shut down, one person can share their WiFi connection through what is essentially a series of repeaters to individuals outside the range of the original WiFi network.

We combined the Tesla API with a margarita mixer we modified to be internet-connected. We take the proximity of your car to your home, and trigger the mixer to start making you a drink! Also, as you arrive, your friends will be notified about the margarita party at your house!
