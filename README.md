#My winning submission for the WWDC 2015 Scholarship.

I ran out of time, and submitted something I knew had issues, both in terms of usability and code reuse. Thankfully, it was good enough to earn me a ticket.

I wanted to fix said issues before open-sourcing this project, because they really aren't indicative of my usual code quality. However, I felt that would be mischaracterizing the quality of my application at the time of submission, so I've decided to commit my code as it was when I submitted it.

My original code is in the second commit of this repository. In order to show that I really am capable of quality code, I will be making further commits fixing the issues I wish I'd had time to address.
